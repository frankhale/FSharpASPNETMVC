#FSharpASPNETMVC

A straight port of the C# ASP.NET MVC 5 project template to F#

##Description

I created a new F# MVC 5 project using the F# MVC 5 templates available in the
Visual Studio Gallery and then I created a new C# ASP.NET MVC 5 project with 
individual logon accounts and then ported it to F#. I copied the assets over
like Javascript, CSS, etc.. and then ported the C# code to F#.

##Status

The app runs, you can register and login but the Manage controller is currently
broke.
