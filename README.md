#FSharpASPNETMVC

A straight port of the C# ASP.NET MVC 5 project template to F#

##Status

The initial port is more than half way complete but some of the code is rough
and probably not idiomatic.  

###Done:
- Web.config
- Scripts
- Contents
- Startup.cs
- Stuff in App_Start
- Models
  
###TODO:
- Finish controllers
- Copy over all the views and make sure they are wired up correctly

##Description

I created a new C# ASP.NET MVC 5 project with individual logon accounts and
then ported it to F#.
